#Tiny Tech Wiki

A small tech wiki which runs off of Markdown files to generate HTML, resulting in an encyclopedia listing different technologies with a small introductory definition. The project utilises Python Django and Bootstrap, and utilises CRUD with Markdown files with added search functionality.
